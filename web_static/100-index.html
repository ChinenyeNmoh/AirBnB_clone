                  <p>The best hotel I have ever been privileged enough to stay at. Gorgeous building, and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk in. High-quality rooms (there was even a TV by the shower), and high-quality service. Also, they are one of the few hotels that allow people under 21 to book a reservation.</p>

                <p>We booked this property as we wanted something close enough to walk to the shops, bars, and restaurants of University Avenue. It was around ten minutes walk so perfect. The property was spacious and clean with great facilities - high-speed wireless broadband and great cable TV. The kitchen was well equipped, and the bedrooms were very comfy - plenty of hanging space, etc., etc..</p>
